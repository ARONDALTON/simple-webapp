# simple-webapp
Build a simple webapp to deploy to heroku.

This app is intended to be the smarts behind the customer filled calculator to
find a customers Actual Energy Use Index.   This value will allow the prioritizing of 
building energy retrofitting projects.  This will help calculate the actual energy use 
that a building uses relative to BC building code and Step Code vaules that a new house 
would reach.  The buildings that have a higher energy index are most likey to reap the 
best rate of return on modifications.
